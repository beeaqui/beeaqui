## About Me 🌟
Hi there!
I am a **researcher** at the University of Coimbra, where I have completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Industrial Engineering and Management. I specialize in developing **innovative active learning methodologies** within **learning factory** environments, leveraging **programming** and **data science** to enhance these approaches. Throughout my academic journey, I have actively sought challenges that pushed me beyond my comfort zone. Research has strengthened my time management by balancing multiple projects, while resilience grew through continuous problem-solving and improvement efforts. Leading training sessions honed my communication and problem-solving skills, guiding students through complex tasks and optimizing workflows in real-time.


## 🌱 Recent Projects

Currently, I'm working on the following projects:
- **Lean and Continuous Improvement Training**: Developing a training course on Lean and continuous improvement in a flexible and adaptable production line, focusing on production management techniques and process optimization.
- **Scientific Paper**: Writing a scientific paper on the application of active learning methodologies in learning factories, exploring how the simulation of production lines and the use of games help teach engineering techniques.
- **Web Application for Production Optimization**: Building a web application using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **MongoDB** to visualize and optimize production planning in a learning factory setting. The app integrates real-time data to monitor key performance indicators and simulates production processes to help improve decision-making and workflow efficiency.
